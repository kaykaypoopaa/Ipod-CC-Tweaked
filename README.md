This ComputerCraft project is supposted to be a ipod thing... sort of. **You will need a advanced noisy pocket computer for this for everything to work!!!**

To install IPodOS (the os name) you need to run this command `wget run https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kaykaypoopaa/Ipod-CC-Tweaked/refs/heads/main/installer.lua`

We (GlitchGod42 and kaykaypoopaa aka lawnman) will be updating this os to fix **BUGS** and add stuff so if you find bugs then make a issue here ig.

Please send your bugs and suggestions in the issues tab and make sure to add the correct tags
